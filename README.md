# Scavenger-Mapper
Map application used during scavenger hunts

Welcome to the Scavenger Hunt Map application!

his is an application for use during scavenger hunts. It is a Google Maps based application.
This app will allow you to enter your hint/clue street address or coordinate locations into the input box and have them placed on the map for easy tracking. ~~In the future~~, you ~~will~~ **__are__** even be able to track the distance between the locations and calculate the quickest route by distance.

To begin, simply start entering your locations in the Hints List input box. DO NOT use the '&' symbol for cross streets, use **__'and'__** instead. And most importantly, the more precise you are with your address, the more accurate the marker will be. Good Luck!
